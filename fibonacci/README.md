# Fibonacci

Print out _N_ steps of the Fibonacci sequence with 1 as the starting number.

This is an excellent exercise to practice your recursion on!

```elixir
iex> Fibonacci.run(12)
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144]
```

## Tests

Tests for the Word Count exercise are implemented as doctests.
To verify your code works and the tests pass you'll need to run:

```shell
$ mix test
```
