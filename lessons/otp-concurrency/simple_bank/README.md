# Simple Bank

In this homework assignment we're going to practice building a GenServer to mimic a bank.
Our bank is expected to allow new accounts, deposits, withdrawls, and balance requests.

We'll take a test-driven approach to this assignment by running the tests and using the failure output to guide us towards the code we need to write to get them passing.

To run the tests, cd into `homework/lessons/otp-concurrency/simple_bank` and run:

```shell
$ mix test
```
